## Introduction

Hi there, I'm Andy Colley, a computer science teacher from Manchester, UK and the creator of this curriculum. Thanks for looking at these resources. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions you can find me on Twitter at [@MrAColley](https://twitter.com/mracolley?lang=en) or email me at [andy@learningdust.com](mailto:andy@learningdust.com).

Happy coding! 


## How To Use This Course

[Intro to Python Demo (Video)](https://youtu.be/GAkda5J2mx8)

This course is designed for students with little or no experience of programming and/or the Python language.  It introduces core programming concepts and techniques used in the vast majority of programming languages.

I’ve split this course into six sessions, each designed to take roughly 2-3 hours  with a homework task as well.

For each session there is a more in depth read me document to help you get started.  This contains  teacher notes to break down the key concepts linked to the coding skills, links to the tasks and example solutions on repl.it and the text of the tasks set.  There’s also a slide deck for each week with presenter notes containing context, subject knowledge cues, possible questions to ask your students and other useful links.

For every task I’ve provided a repl for you to assign to your students. I’ve createdan example solutions. There are often multiple ways of completing a task, so students may well have different code that works (mine often do).


## Pedagogy

I have made use of the PRIMM pedagogical approach in this course.  This model follows the following structure:

|Stage | Possible Activities | Why? |
|---|---|---|
|Predict|In pairs look at a piece of code printed out or on the whiteboard and ask students what they think it will do. They can write down their prediction or discuss in a group class discussion. Live coding is quite useful here or the code can be already prepared.|This activity encourages students to look for clues in the program that suggest what its function is.|
|Run|Fork the example code on repl.it and check against your prediction.|Having code that is provided has many benefits – it moves the weight of ownership of any errors from the student to the teacher, increasing confidence, and it also means that time is not spent copying in code, which can be a challenging exercise to students who struggle with literacy at any level.|
|Investigate|There are lots of different activities you can do at this stage: trace through the code, comment the code, answer questions about it, label particular concepts, highlight it, draw the flow of control, etc.  Again pair work helps to encourage discussion about the nitty gritty of the program.|It takes many activities of this type, repeated in different forms in different lessons, for students to start to understand the underlying concepts in a secure way. We may tend to think that writing one selection statement correctly means that students have a good understanding of selection but really “getting” this takes some time.|
| Modify |Given a working piece of code, students are challenged to add a variety of modifications, starting very simply and having a series of exercises increasing in difficulty with larger modifications. |The transfer of ownership moves from the code being “not mine” to “partly mine” as students gain confidence by extending the function of the code. This activity obviously provides the scaffolding that students need to add small snippets of code and see their effect within a bigger program.  |
| Make|Once students are confident in modifying the program that you have created, they can create their own program from scratch, which has similarities with the previous program but that they can design themselves. |Design of a new program is an important skill, and should start with planning and trying to construct a suitable algorithm. This is difficult, but does give students an opportunity to be creative and have the satisfaction of making their own program. |

The lesson tasks give you a start point and some ideas for applying the PRIMM model.  Depending on your students you may need to add in more examples of your own.  I wouldn’t recommend skipping tasks, especially with beginner coders, as practice is vital to embed the skills & understanding needed for independence.
